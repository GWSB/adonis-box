## Adonis-Box

Adonis-Box is a no frills vagrant box built specifically for running AdonisJS applications on Ubuntu 16.04.
Designed from the start with simplicity in mind. No complicated setup required.
Simply clone this repo and run `vagrant up` and you're pretty much ready to start coding.

### Get Started

1) Clone this repo and `cd` into it's new directory

2) Run `vagrant up`

3) Run `vagrant ssh`

4) Run `cd /var/www/ && adonis new <your application name>`

5) Run `adonis serve --dev` and open `http://192.168.33.10/` in your browser

There should now be a new folder in your local machine's root directory with your applications name. Open that in your favorite text editor and get to coding!
